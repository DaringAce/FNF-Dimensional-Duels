            "This is the house that Ace resides in. He built it from specialized custom material that Ace forged by himself, representing a hard-forged element of emerald. The created material is very tough, as it was melded throughout. The pumpkin Ace planted in the front of the yard was found in another dimension and is a defensive artifact that can create vines at hot temperatures. These vines burn intruders and trap them in place until Ace decides the best course of action to deal with them. It is impossible to pluck the pumpkin out of its place. Behind the fence, Ace plants golden roses and other rare flowers to preserve them.", "The forest Ace built his house in is classified location-wise. Only Ace and Luna are allowed inside and outside of the forest. Ace has control of the forest, and is able to use his powers to communicate with the species living in it and to repair and/or to modify anything of the forest's scenery. He has even accomplished making the entire area of the forest waterproof and floodproof."

            "The City Cliff stage takes place at nighttime on a blood moon. The cliff is located southwest of the neightboring forest to the forest containing Ace's house. Below the rocky cliff, there is a city that is unaware of Ace's and Luna's presence at the cliff during during the night that the song, Uncertainty, takes place.", "During the song, Ace is attempting to lead Luna during her uncontrollable-state, because of the blood moon, away from the city's civilization. Usually, Ace is easily able to persuade Luna's uncontrollable-state to feed on him to satisfy the bloodthirst she feels during a blood moon. During the time of the song, though, it is shown that Ace is having a harder time trying to persuade Luna's uncontrollable-state than that of which he usually does."
